# Harrison Neighborhood

View the Neighborhood Picture Tour

The Harrison Neighborhood is North Minneapolis' southernmost neighborhood. It is bounded by Olson Memorial Highway on the north, Bassett's Creek on the south, Lyndale Avenue to the east, and Theodore Wirth Park to the west. Toward the southeastern edge is International Market Square which is home to a large number of interior design and home / commercial designer showrooms, the American Institute of Architects Minnesota offices, and residential loft space. Along Glenwood Avenue you will find additional businesses related to the design industry . Around the corner is the Minneapolis Farmers' Market. Harrison is also adjacent to the southern portion of the old Sumner-Glenwood Neighborhood. The old Minneapolis housing projects, which once stood on this site are being replaced with townhomes, single family housing, senior citizen housing, and apartments. Also included will be a new parkway connecting to the Loring Park Neighborhood. Due to recent plans for the redevelopment of Basset Creek Valley , a natural amenity will be restored to the Harrison Neighborhood.
