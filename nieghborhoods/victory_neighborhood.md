Along this drive you will find a large number of beautiful homes with various architectural designs along with Ryan Lake, one of North Minneapolis' finest lakes. Victory neighborhood also includes Loring Elementary School and features a few small neighborhood business districts located near 44th and Penn Avenue North, and 42nd and Thomas Avenue North.
