# Sumner-Glenwood Neighborhood (Heritage Park)

View the Neighborhood Picture Tour

The Sumner-Glenwood Neighborhood was the location of Sumner Field Homes , which in 1938 were the first public housing units built in the state of Minnesota. The area was also the subject of a lawsuit, filed in 1992, which stemmed from resident complaints that the area was unsafe and in poor condition. From this lawsuit, the old homes were torn down and replaced with over 900 new housing units including garden apartments, townhomes, single-family residences, carriage houses, and a new senior complex. This area is now called Heritage Park and is a mixed income, high amenity community. It has an innovative green infrastructure design that harvests rainwater for a series of water features that form the central amenity in a public park and boulevard tying the site to the surrounding neighborhoods. Public improvements include a new north-south boulevard greenway, a transformed park at Sumner Field, upgraded athletic fields at Bethune Park, along with a redesigned Olson Memorial Highway and Lyndale Avenue North.
