# Jordan Neighborhood

View the Neighborhood Picture Tour

The Jordan Neighborhood is located northeast of West Broadway, south of Lowry Avenue, and west of Emerson Avenue. Jordan features a diverse housing stock primarily built in the early 20th century to the 1940s. On Jordan 's northern edge is the North Regional Library, which is currently undergoing extensive remodeling. The reconstruction of Lowry Avenue will be concurrent with plans for additional housing. On the corner of Lowry and Penn Avenue a new development will be starting that includes new retail. West Broadway Avenue recently finished reconstruction in 2005. Improvements include new traffic lanes, sidewalks, lighting, and medians. In the next few years these changes will make a big difference in the Jordan neighborhood.
