# Cleveland Neighborhood

View the Neighborhood Picture Tour

The Cleveland Neighborhood is one of North Minneapolis' smallest neighborhoods… yet it's said to have a big heart! A notable feature of this area is Victory Memorial Drive on the westernmost edge. Along this famous two block wide drive you will find expansive vistas, walking / bike trials, and lined rows of large mature trees. Homes located along this drive are most desirable because of the views they offer. The interior neighborhood features a mix of quality housing with a large number of Tudor and Craftsman style homes. It is also home to one of Minneapolis' bungalow districts known as the “Nichols-Frissell Bungalow Grove.” Penn Avenue runs along the eastern border of the Cleveland Neighborhood. Here you will find the Penn-Lowry Business district, Cleveland Park, and Lucy-Craft Laney School at Cleveland Park. North Minneapolis' Post Office is also located on Lowry Avenue, on Cleveland's southern edge. The Cleveland Neighborhood is a community with diversity. Each of its residents has a unique perspective, yet all share common goals in their visions of a nice place to live.
