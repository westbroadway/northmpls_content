# Lind-Bohanon Neighborhood

View the Neighborhood Picture Tour

The Lind-Bohanon Neighborhood was incorporated by the City of Minneapolis in 1887 and is located on Minneapolis' far north side. It is bounded on the north by 53rd Avenue North and Brooklyn Center, with its eastern border the Mississippi River, western boundary Humboldt Avenue North, and southern boundary Webber Park / The Canadian Pacific Rail Road. Lind-Bohanon covers over 500 acres and is smaller than one square mile. The two major parks in this neighborhood are the North Mississippi Regional Park and Lind-Bohanon Park. Shingle Creek also runs through this area. The new development called "The Humboldt Greenway" is partially in the Lind-Bohanon neighborhood. Included in this develpment are new single family homes, townhomes, assisted living housing, newly reconstructed streets, sidewalks, lighting, and a greenway to the North Mississippi Regional Park. The housing in this area was built primarily in the 40s, 50s and 60s. Most of the neighborhood businesses can be found along Lyndale Avenue North. The neighborhood and its elementary school are named for Jenny Lind, a famous Swedish soprano born in the first half of the 19th century and John Bohanon, the area's first settler.
