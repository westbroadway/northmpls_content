The Webber-Camden Neighborhood features Webber Park along the northern edge, which has one of Minneapolis' largest outdoor swimming pools. It also contains a small scenic pond, and waterfalls. Webber Parkway runs through this neighborhood and connects to Memorial Drive, which is a part of the Minneapolis Grand Rounds. There are several small business districts around the neighborhood with the most quaint of these located along 42nd and Fremont Avenue. The neighborhood is filled with homes of the Victorian, Foursquare, Tudor, and Craftsman styles. Part of North Minneapolis is often referred to as the Camden Area, which is centers on the Webber-Camden Neighborhood and encompasses all of the neighborhoods north of Lowry Avenue. The Camden area is rich in history including strong ties to the logging industry.
