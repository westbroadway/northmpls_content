# Folwell Neighborhood

View the Neighborhood Picture Tour

Located in the center of North Minneapolis, Folwell Neighborhood is a scenic area filled with hills and quality built homes. Similar to several nearby neighborhoods, it has many Bungalow, Tudor and Craftsman style homes. The neighborhood features Folwell Park, which is bordered by Crystal Cemetery to the north. The Community Center at Folwell Park includes basketball courts, community rooms, and an activity center. On the Southern edge of the Folwell Neighborhood is Lowry Avenue. In the process of being rebuilt, it will include rapid bus transit, bike lanes, new sidewalks, lighting, and a new road layout. The new Minneapolis Fire Station #14 will be completed in 2006 along the corridor as well.
