# Hawthorne Neighborhood

View the Neighborhood Picture Tour

The Hawthorne Neighborhood is located just west of the Mississippi River, north of West Broadway Avenue, south of Lowry Avenue, and east of Emerson Avenue. This older neighborhood contains many turn of the century Victorians, Foursquares, and historic concrete block homes. Farview Park dominates the center of this neighborhood with stunning views of the city from the top of its hill. A new elementary school was recently built just off Lyndale Avenue. Along West Broadway are a number of restaurants, drug stores, and shops. Hawthorne Crossings Shopping Center is also located in this West Broadway Business district. Townhomes were recently constructed along the Mississippi River and take advantage of the views of the river and downtown Minneapolis. Eventually this riverfront area will be redeveloped as part of the Upper Mississippi Master Plan.
